# TI CC3200 Fall Down Detector

This product is named as “Fall Detector” and it is generally used as the Internet-of-Things (IOT) system for people who need help when they get injured by falling down. It has three parts: (1) Texas Instruments (TI) CC3200 Launchpad with 3-axis accelerometer for processing, (2) Adafruit OLED Screen for displaying message sending status, and (3) Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Notification Services (SNS) for sending messages to the contacts. For the usage, the user wears it on their body and the accelerometer will monitor the motion of the subject. Once the user falls down, there is a large value of acceleration and the board will be prepared to send message. Once it is confirmed, it will send message or continue detecting.

NOTE: This project is based on personal AWS services. PLEASE DO NOT USE THE CODE DIRECTLY.
